        <h2>Our Core Principle: Your Privacy First</h2>
        <p>
            TubeSpire is designed to be a private and anonymous service. We believe you should be able to use our tool
            without worrying about your data being tracked or stored.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>
            We want to be crystal clear about what we <strong>do not</strong> do:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No User Accounts:</strong> We do not require you to sign up or create an account.</li>
            <li><strong>No IP Address Logging:</strong> We do not store your IP address in connection with your usage.
            </li>
            <li><strong>No Download History:</strong> The URLs you paste are processed in real-time and are never saved
                to a database.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Information We Do Collect</h2>
        <p>
            To maintain the health and security of our service, we collect a minimal amount of non-personally
            identifiable information:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aggregated Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous traffic data, such
                as which pages are visited most often and the general country of origin of our visitors. This helps us
                understand how our service is used and where we can improve. This data is aggregated and cannot be tied
                to an individual user.</li>
            <li><strong>Error Logs:</strong> If our service encounters an error during a download request, our server
                may log the type of error and the video URL that caused it. This is purely for debugging purposes to
                help us fix bugs and is automatically deleted on a regular basis.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
            We use a single, functional cookie (<code>downloadComplete</code>) to improve your user experience by hiding
            the loading animation after your file has been sent. This cookie contains no personal information and
            automatically expires.
