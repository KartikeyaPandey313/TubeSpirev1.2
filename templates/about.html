    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      TubeSpire was born from a difficulty: not able to download high quality
      videos from the internet without a convoluted process. We believe that
      downloading should be easy, secure, and available to everyone, regardless
      of their internet connection. We are a team of developers and designers
      passionate about creating powerful tools that are clean, intuitive, and
      respectful of user privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Technology</h2>
    <p>
      Our service is built on the shoulders of giants. We utilize the powerful
      and constantly updated <code>yt-dlp</code> library, which is the gold
      standard for online media downloading. This allows us to interface with a
      vast array of video platforms and formats, ensuring we can always fetch
      the highest quality streams available. Our backend, powered by Flask, is
      designed to be lightweight and efficient, processing your requests with
      speed and reliability.
    </p>

    <h2>Commitment to Privacy & Security</h2>
    <p>
      We believe that your activity is your own. TubeSpire does not require user
      accounts, and we do not store your download history or IP addresses. Every
      request is processed ephemerally. For a full breakdown, please see our
      <a href="{{ url_for('privacy') }}">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

      We are a team of developers and designers passionate about creating
      powerful tools that are clean, intuitive, and respectful of user privacy.
