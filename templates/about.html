    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      TubeSpire was born from a simple idea: access to online video content
      should be easy, secure, and available to everyone, regardless of their
      internet connection. We are a team of developers and designers passionate
      about creating powerful tools that are clean, intuitive, and respectful
      of user privacy.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Technology</h2>
    <p>
      Our service is built on the shoulders of giants. We utilize the powerful
      and constantly updated <code>yt-dlp</code> library, which is the gold
      standard for online media downloading. This allows us to interface with a
      vast array of video platforms and formats, ensuring we can always fetch
      the highest quality streams available. Our backend, powered by Flask, is
      designed to be lightweight and efficient, processing your requests with
      speed and reliability.
    </p>

    <h2>Commitment to Privacy & Security</h2>
    <p>
      We believe that your activity is your own. TubeSpire does not require
      user accounts, and we do not store your download history or IP addresses.
      Every request is processed ephemerally. For a full breakdown, please see
      our <a href="{{ url_for('privacy') }}">Privacy Policy</a>.
