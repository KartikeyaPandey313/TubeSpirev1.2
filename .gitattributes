# This file defines attributes for pathnames to maintain consistent behavior
# and formatting across the repository, regardless of the contributor's OS.

# --- Global Settings ---
# Auto-detect text files and normalize all line endings to LF (Line Feed).
# This is the standard for Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS) and prevents
# cross-platform line ending conflicts (CRLF vs. LF).
* text=auto eol=lf

# --- Specific File Type Enforcement ---
# Explicitly tell Git to treat these file types as text with LF line endings.
# This overrides any auto-detection and ensures consistency.
*.py      text eol=lf
*.html    text eol=lf
*.css     text eol=lf
*.js      text eol=lf
*.md      text eol=lf
*.txt     text eol=lf
*.xml     text eol=lf
*.yml     text eol=lf
*.svg     text eol=lf

# --- Binary Files ---
# Explicitly tell Git to treat these common image formats as binary files.
# This prevents Git from attempting to normalize their line endings, which
# would corrupt the files.
